        How the delivery charge is calculated for multiple units and some
        products
      </div>

      <div>
        For multiple products ordered the program adds up the weight of all the
        units ordered and charges a single delivery fee.
      </div>
      <div>
        However, the delivery fee is calculated separately when a customer
        orders different plants to be delivered at different locations. This is
        because the products are being sourced and shipped from different
        cities.
      </div>
      <div>
        <div className="font-bold text-black">Disclaimer</div>
        The product will be delivered for all urban areas in India serviceable
        by major courier agencies. For remote/rural areas the product will be
        sent by local couriers / Indian Speed Post and may take more time.
