        We have a 24 Hr return policy, which means you have 1 day after
        receiving your item to request a return.
      </div>
      <div>
        To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
        that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
        packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.

      <div>
        To start a return, you can contact us at plantogallery@gmail.com. If
        your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well
        as for instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent
        back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.

          Exceptions / non-returnable items
        </div>
        Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such
        as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or
        personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty products).
        We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable
        liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns
        about your specific item.
      </div>

      <div>
        Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
      </div>
      <div>
        <div className="text-black font-bold ">Exchanges</div>
        The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
        you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for
        the new item.
      </div>

      <div>
        <div className="text-black font-bold ">Refunds</div>
        We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
        let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
        automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember
        it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process
        and post the refund too.
